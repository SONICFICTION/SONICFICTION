- 👋 Hi, I’m @SONICFICTION
- 👀 I’m interested in music composition, audio engineering and sonic manipultion, and learning about electronics and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code (mostly for an arduino), as well as basic electronic engineering. My goal is to build my own synthesizers. Eventually.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of the above?
